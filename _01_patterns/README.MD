# 📘DSA Chapter 01 - Pattern Practice

This Folder contains my practice work on **pattern printing problems**.  
Before starting **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, I am strengthening my basics with **loops and logic building** through patterns.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Improve understanding of **nested loops**.
- Learn how to **break problems into smaller parts**.
- Get comfortable with **symmetry and alignment logic**.
- Build strong fundamentals before moving to **DSA**.

---

## 🛠️ Tricks I Follow to Solve Patterns

1. **Outer Loop → Rows**  
   - Count how many rows/lines are needed.  
   - Example: 5 rows → `for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)`.

2. **Inner Loop → Columns**  
   - Figure out how many columns per row.  
   - Example: Row 1 → 1 star, Row 2 → 2 stars.

3. **Print Inside Inner Loop**  
   - Decide what to print: `"*"`, numbers, or alphabets.  

4. **Observe Symmetry (Optional)**  
   - Helpful in pyramids, diamonds, and palindromes.

## 📌 Why Patterns?
- Strengthens **problem-solving mindset**.
- Builds **foundation for nested loops**.
- Helps in **logic clarity** before advanced topics.

## 🚀 Next Steps
After practicing patterns:
1. Move to **basic DSA (arrays, strings)**.  
2. Start **problem-solving** on platforms like LeetCode, CodeStudio, or GFG.  
3. Gradually tackle **recursion-based patterns**.
