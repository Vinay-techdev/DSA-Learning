# DSA  Chapter 02 – Basic Math Practice

This Folder contains my practice exercises in *basic mathematics* as a foundation for *Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)*.  
Before jumping into DSA, it’s important to strengthen problem-solving skills and understand *time & space complexity*.

## 📌 Topics Covered

1. *Extract and Count Digits* – Learn to manipulate and analyze digits of a number.  
2. *Reverse Number* – Reverse a given integer using loops or mathematical operations.  
3. *Palindrome Number* – Check if a number reads the same forwards and backwards.  
4. *Armstrong Number* – Verify if a number equals the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.  
5. *Print All Divisors* – Efficiently find all divisors of a number.  
6. *Prime Number* – Check if a number is prime using basic and optimized approaches.  
7. *GCD / HCF* – Find the Greatest Common Divisor of two numbers using Euclid’s algorithm.
